# Adoptly Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS + Bootstrap</strong>

After a month of doing little exercises and mini-projects that were mostly other people’s code, I’m excited I can finally post a project!

I’m still working through Codecademy’s layout projects. This is the first one that felt like the starter code they provided was negligible.

I visually matched <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/adoptly/index.html">codecademy’s example</a> and used Bootstrap columns and jumbotron, but rolled my own navbar and hovers.

I’m enjoying figuring out more of the weird quirks of CSS, but I miss programming and am looking forward to some interactive pages.
