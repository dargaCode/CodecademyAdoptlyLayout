# Adoptly Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

After a month of doing little exercises and mini-projects that were mostly other people’s code, I’m excited I can finally post a project!

I’m still working through Codecademy’s layout projects. This is the first one that felt like the starter code they provided was negligible.

I visually matched codecademy’s example and used Bootstrap columns and jumbotron, but rolled my own navbar and hovers.

I’m enjoying figuring out more of the weird quirks of CSS, but I miss programming and am looking forward to some interactive pages.
